Welcome to my HTML Projects repository! This repository contains code for two complete projects using HTML.

Project 1: Event Page
In the first project, I build an Event Page covering fundamental HTML components, such as heading tags (<h1> to <h6>), paragraph tags (<p>), anchor tags (<a>), body tag (<body>), HTML boilerplate (<html>), and image tag (<img>). By the end of this project, I had an clear understanding of how to structure basic HTML elements to create appealing Event Pages.

Project 2: Tables and Forms
The second project delves into HTML tables and forms. Tables present data in a structured format using tags like <table>, <tr> (table row), <th> (table header cell), and <td> (table data cell). Forms, essential for user input and data submission, utilize tags such as <form>, various input types (<input>), <textarea>, <select>, <option>, <label>, and <button>. By completing this project, am proficient in creating tables and forms, and processing user input effectively.
